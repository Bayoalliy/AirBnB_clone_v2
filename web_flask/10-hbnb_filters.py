Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the
storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) =>
from models import storage and storage.all(...)
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/states_list: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in
DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>

Routes:
/hbnb_filters: display a HTML page like 6-index.html, which was done during the-
project 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
Copy files 3-footer.css, 3-header.css, 4-common.css and 6-filters.css-
from web_static/styles/ to the folder web_flask/static/styles
Copy files icon.png and logo.png from web_static/images/ to the folder web_flask/static/images
Update .popover class in 6-filters.css to allow scrolling in the popover and a max height of 300 pixels.
Use 6-index.html content as source code for the template 10-hbnb_filters.html:
Replace the content of the H4 tag under each filter title (H3 States and H3 Amenities) by &nbsp;
State, City and Amenity objects must be loaded from DBStorage and sorted by name
